Munnar is divided into Old Munnar, where the tourist information office is, and Munnar, where the bus station and most guest houses are located. The Eravikulam National Park, Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary and tea plantations are its major attractions. Munnar is also famous for being home to the rare Neelakurinji flowers that bloom once in 12 years (the next bloom is in 2030) and the endangered Nilgiri Tahr.
Once the summer resort of the erstwhile British government, the main reason to visit Munnar is to explore the tea plantations that looks like a blanket of green spread all over. It is also an ideal place for trekking, camping, paragliding and boating.  Munnar is a haven for shopping for tea and spices. Cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, coffee and a variety of homemade chocolates can be bought from the number of shops spread across the hill town.

Fort Kochi is a seaside town in the south-western part of Main Kochi which is known for its old-world colonial charm. The place still holds on to every single cultural change it has gone through over the centuries. We can see the remnants of British rule all over the country. The tourists' flock hear all around the year to have a glimpse of how Portuguese or Dutch colonialism affected parts of our country.
This quaint city is dotted with European structures and has an overall ambience that keeps reminding you of the colonial powers that once ruled over the place. Till date, it has the vibe of an ancient colonial city with its toy-town like streets, colourful and charming buildings and a picturesque view out at the beach - much like the small towns of southern Europe.

Formerly known as Calicut, Kozhikode is located in Kerala. It was the Capital of Malabar during the Zamorin rule 500 years ago and is famous for its centuries-old trade in cotton and spices with Jews, Arabs, Phoenicians and Chinese. Basking in the idyllic setting of the serene Arabian Sea on the west and the proud peaks of the Wayanad hills on the east, this district with the serene beaches, lush green countryside, historic sites, all combine to make Kozhikode a popular tourist destination.
Vasco da Gama had set his foot on the remote beach of Kappad in Kozhikode in 1498 and 'Discovered India' and established spice trade routes with the west. Kozhikode city is the marketing centre for commodities like pepper coconut, coffee, rubber, lemongrass oil etc., produced in Kozhikode and the neighbouring districts of Wayanad, Malappuram and Kannur.  Being the major trade centre in Malabar and major exporter to foreign countries, the international travellers christened this district as ‘the noble emporium of India’.

Officially known as the cultural capital of Kerala, Thrissur is famous for fostering classical Keralan performing arts, religious sites and the renowned  Thrissur Pooram festival, Onam festival and Vadakkumnathan Temple.

Thrissur is the short form of Thiru-Shiva-Per-Ur which literally means “a city with three temples of Lord Shiva”. Thrissur later became anglicised to Trichur. 

Thrissur is from where Kerala gets a fair share of its festive glitter. Thrissur was the capital of the Kingdom of Kochi. The festivals celebrated here are the major attraction for tourists and a visit to Thrissur is incomplete without witnessing these. Other tourist spots in Thrissur include the Vadakkumnathan Kshetram Temple, Tomb of Shakthan Thampuran, Archaeology Museum, Athirapally Falls, Heritage Garden and many more.
